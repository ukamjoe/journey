    <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
    <p>My name is UKAM JOSEPH AGBANIMUSHUYE i am a  Cyber Security graduate of AIR FORCE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,KADUNA.
        I was born on the 29th of November 2002 in Lagos State and have been interested in Tech for a 
        long time so  i went ahead to study a course under it, right now i am a student of AltschoolAfrica 
        in the frontend engineering department with my school id number ""
    </p>

    <P>Joining altschool was not neccesarily on the vision board of mine but they caught my attention a few months 
        back when i saw all the glowing review of the graduates they have brought out of thier program so I decided
        to join them and so far i have'nt regretted my decision, if i was asked the main reason why i joined AltschoolAfrica
        i would say it was to gain more knowledge and experience along with meeting nr=ew people who are also in tech
